A simple Laravel implementation for all payment providers. This package supports 
Paystack, Monnify, Pay4Me Pay, Seerbit Flutterwave, Klasha, and Stripe.

## Use Case
Have you had to implement limited SDKs for accepting payments on your mobile app. 
That's the problem this package solved.

With this package you can generate a payment link and 
return it to your mobile app API call and the payment can be completed on the inapp browser.

When the customer completes their payment, this package verifies the payment and execute the code defined inside your 
custom closure. 

The closure should look like this:

```php
use Stephenjude\PaymentGateway\DataObjects\TransactionData;

function (TransactionData $payment){
    $order->update([
        'status' => $payment->status, 
        'amount' => $payment->amount, 
        'currency' => $payment->currency
    ]);
    
    $customer->notify(new OrderPaymentNotification($order));
}
```

If you are using this package on the web this closure is the place where you can return a redirect after updating the customers order or sent notification.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require stephenjude/laravel-payment-gateways
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="payment-gateways-config"
```

Optionally, you can publish the views using

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="payment-gateways-views"
```

## Usage
This package currently supports `paystack`, `monnify`, `pay4me`, `seerbit`, `flutterwave`, `klasha` and `stripe`.

### How to initialize a payment session

```php
use Stephenjude\PaymentGateway\PaymentGateway;
use Stephenjude\PaymentGateway\DataObjects\TransactionData;

$provider = PaymentGateway::make('paystack')

$paymentSession = $provider->initializeCheckout([
    'currency' => 'NGN', // required
    'amount' => 100, // required
    'email' => 'customer@email.com', // required
    'meta' => [ 'name' => 'Stephen Jude', 'phone' => '081xxxxxxxxx'],
    'closure' => function (TransactionData $payment){
        /* 
         * Payment verification happens immediately after the customer makes payment. 
         * The payment data gotten from the verification will be injected into this closure.
         */
        logger('payment details', [
           'currency' => $payment->currency, 
           'amount' => $payment->amount, 
           'status' => $payment->status,
           'reference' => $payment->reference,   
           'provider' => $payment->provider,   
           'date' => $payment->date,                   
        ]);
    },
]);

$paymentSession->provider;
$paymentSession->checkoutUrl;
$paymentSession->expires;

$provider->listTransactions();

$transaction = $provider->findTransaction(REFERENCE);


```
### Accessing payament transaction data
```php
// List all transactions from this provider
$provider->listTransactions();

// Find a transaction by REFERENCE
$transaction = $provider->findTransaction(REFERENCE);

// Transaction data object
$transaction->provider;
$transaction->email;
$transaction->amount;
$transaction->currency;
$transaction->reference;
$transaction->status;
$transaction->date;
